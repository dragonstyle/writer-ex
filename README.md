# writer-ex

Requires the very latest pre-release of Quarto to run (configure as developer and git pull main).

To render, use `quarto render test.qmd` which will output an HTML file that is being generated by the custom writer (just the Pandoc sample writer).

You can also use the `template:` option if you'd like to additionally provide a template, such as:

```
format:
  sample.lua:
    output-ext: html
    template: mytemplate.html
```

(if you don't provide a template, it will really just emit a fragment with none of the header nonsense)
